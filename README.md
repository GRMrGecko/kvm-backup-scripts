# KVM Backup Scripts

These are scripts I wrote to perform backup of KVM images in my homelab environment. I am publishing them here for the case it is useful to someone. These scripts backups to a (borg backup)[https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html] archive, as that is my favorite backup software.
